## Thanks

Thank you to those who encouraged me, and to everyone who plays this!

My special gratitude to [Fritzy](https://twitter.com/fritzy) for leading me to participate in this jam, which was my first ever game jam. Fritzy made an [awesome library](https://t.co/UYMr93nCmG?amp=1) that I used for this game, and they're just an all-around helpful and kind person!
